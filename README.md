## Self-Reflection

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
-I started this assignment around November 29th and transferred the components form previous assignments into this one. Then around December 7th I started working on the project for the Peer Review and created a functional Wordle Game and tried to fix network errors. After that, on Decmber 11th, I worked on the project every single day for hours. 

- **What do you think of this completion time?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
I feel okay about it, but I wish it didn't take as long in terms of how many hours I was working on it a day. I am glad that I did not feel pressed for time on it the day of the deadline.

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
- <!-- Answer below this line -->
- I would try to section my time working on the project into little bits per day, if I didn't have other projects or exams to study for. I also would've liked to not use ChatGPT as much, or if at all, in terms of help with debugging issues or logic I got stuck on.
